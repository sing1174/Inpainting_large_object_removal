### Region filling and Object removal by Inpainting: 
This was a paper implementation project which was part of my Image Processing coursework. Please refer to this [report](https://github.com/1998anwesha/Inpainting_large_object_removal/blob/main/Object_removal_by_inpainting_Anwesha_Samaddar.pdf) for an overview of the project.
All the functions used are present in the Inpainting_code.ipynb file. The images and masks used are all present in main folder for ease of access. You can simply run the .ipynb file to check the results.
